# advent_of_code_2025

**setup readme still to come, I've been goofing off playing games instead of preparing my AoC repo**

This year I am using AoC to practive rust with no_std -- at least while it is easy :)

## day 1 

got my template working for no_std

## day 2

nicely:

- No heap allocation
- No Vec, HashMap, String, formatting
- Boundary-safe slice manipulation
- Borrowed data only
- Feature-gated logic
- Separation of Part 1 / Part 2 behavior
- No unnecessary unsafe
